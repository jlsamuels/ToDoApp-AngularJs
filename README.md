# ToDoApp-AngularJs
To-Do application that demonstrates the use of the AngularJs framework along with Typescript. 
Download VSCode 
Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Install the Angular CLI within the commandline : npm install -g @angular/cli
I recommend installing the Angular Console within VSCode (Easier UI to use than the cli)
I am going to include the node files in the repo.
